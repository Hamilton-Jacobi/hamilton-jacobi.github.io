    name: Hamilton And Jacobi
    description: The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a reformulation of classical mechanics and, thus, equivalent to other formulations such as Newton's laws of motion, Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is particularly useful in identifying conserved quantities for mechanical systems, which may be possible even when the mechanical problem itself cannot be solved completely.
